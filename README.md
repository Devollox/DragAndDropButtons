# DragAndDropButtons
 A site where buttons are dragged, with a bezier curve and a draggable background
# Info
 The site was created in React, there is already a file for deployment on the server. You can watch the demo - https://netcore.fun/
 Not perfect, but a good example. There are several problems with curves. If you fix it I will be grateful :D
